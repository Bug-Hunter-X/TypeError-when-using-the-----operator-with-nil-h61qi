This repository contains a Ruby program that demonstrates a TypeError that occurs when the '+' operator is used with a nil value. The program defines a class called 'MyClass' that has an instance variable called '@value'. The 'my_method' method of this class increments the value of '@value' and returns the new value. If the program is run with a 'nil' value for '@value', it will cause a TypeError. The solution demonstrates how to handle the case where '@value' is nil to prevent the error.
